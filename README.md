# hello-world
My first repository
I have always loved programming from a young age.  I have always working in programming to some capacity but usually in languages that were specific to the systems/job that I held.  Wanting to branch out I have learned Python and am really into back end web developement so I started learning Django.  I'm really excited to find out where all of this will take me :)
